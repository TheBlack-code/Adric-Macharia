 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Macharia's Journey</h3></summary> 
   As a Cyber-Security Graduate from Chestnut Hill College, I have developed a keen interest in the constantly-evolving digital world. My educational background has provided me with a strong foundation in topics such as cryptography, network security, and ethical hacking, which I have been able to apply to real-world scenarios through various projects and internships.
</p>
My journey in Cyber-Security began as a curious student, eager to learn about the intricacies of technology. As I delved deeper into this field, I realized that I was particularly fascinated by code, KALI, Linux, and MySQL, which motivated me to acquire in-depth knowledge of these areas. While pursuing my studies, I also developed an interest in iOS development and taught myself how to code with the goal of building my own app.
</p>
However, as I continued to learn more about Cyber-Security, I realized that my true passion lay in this field. I was drawn to the challenging and ever-changing nature of the work, and I knew that this was the path I wanted to pursue. This realization led me to explore different career options in Cyber-Security, and I ultimately decided to aim for a role as an IT Auditor, SOC Analyst, or Cyber-Analyst.
</p>
As someone who is passionate about self-learning, I have also been able to pursue my interests in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) while working in Cyber-Security. I am constantly seeking out new resources and opportunities to expand my knowledge in this area, as I believe that a strong foundation in emerging technologies will be essential for success in the Cyber-Security field.
</p>
Overall, my journey in Cyber-Security has been an exciting and rewarding one. I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had thus far, and I am eager to continue learning and growing as a Cyber-Security Padawan.
